# Unity-SketchApp-Import

The SketchApp Import is a minimalistic plugin for Unity, bringing UI components and UI prototypes designed in Sketch into your Unity projects. 

The plugin is currently based and dependent on the export files provided by Framer Generator, loading PNG assets as sprite images and position them correctly based to your design.

As the Framer Generator also supports exporting from Photshop and Flinto the plugin can also be used to import Photoshop and Flinto designs into Unity
